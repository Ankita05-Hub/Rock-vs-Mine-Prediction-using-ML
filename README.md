The Rock vs Mine Detection project applies machine learning to classify sonar signals as either rocks or underwater mines. It uses a dataset containing sonar returns bounced off different objects to train a classification model. Features from the signals are analyzed to detect patterns and differences between the two classes. Models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest are commonly used for accurate prediction. This project has practical applications in naval defense and underwater exploration. It demonstrates how ML can improve safety and automate detection in challenging environments.
